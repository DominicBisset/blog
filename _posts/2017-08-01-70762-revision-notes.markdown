# Part 1 - Designing and Implementing Database Objects

* Base on business reqs. findn nouns, then attributes, then identifiers for rows
* schemas - security/organisational grouplings of tables and code
* normalisation - to be in stricter form have to comply to looser forms
  * shape of table - relation - no duplicaated rows - id by key, including artificial keys; prefer natural if possible - artifical has  no business meaning
    * 1NF
      * atomic (each col represents 1 val) - split into multpile cols - avoids partial queries on cols
      * same amount of data per row (no arrays in cells) - split if fixed no, or new table
  * relation of non key attributes to key  - prevent redundant data going out of sync
    * 2NF attributes must be about whole pk, not subset therof (comp. keys only)
    * 3NF attributes must be about pk, not other attributes
      * 3NF = boyce-codd NF
      *
