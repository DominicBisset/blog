This is a Hello World of sorts for a Jekyll-generated static site hosted on Azure

Mostly I'm following the [Publish a website with Jekyll and Github on Windows Azure][1] tutorial from [ANHELEDIR.NET][2].

It's not working so well now.  I can't get it to do build server-side.  Further investigation suggests the extension installer is failing.  

I'm now trying alternative installation instructions from [Deploying Jekyll to Windows Azure App Services][3]
